">ACT I [Scene—The ruins of the The Temple of the Gods, on summit of
    Mount Olympus.  Picturesque shattered columns, overgrown with
    ivy, etc. R. and L. with entrances to temple (ruined) R. Fallen
    columns on the stage. Three broken pillars 2 R.E.  At the back of
    stage is the approach from the summit of the mountain. This
    should be "practicable" to enable large numbers of people to
    ascend and descend.  In the distance are the summits of adjacent
    mountains. At first all this is concealed by a thick fog, which
    clears presently.  Enter (through fog) Chorus of Stars coming off
    duty as fatigued with their night's work]</h4>

    <p class="chorus">CHO.  Through the night, the constellations,
    Have given light from various stations.
    When midnight gloom falls on all nations,
    We will resume our occupations.</p>

    <p class="speech Apollo">Christmas boxes ought to be something considerable. </p>
   
    <h5 class="name">MER.</h5>
    <p class="speech Mercury"> They ought to be but they're not.  I'm treated abominably.
    I make everybody and I'm nobody.  I go everywhere and I'm
    nowhere.  I do everything and I'm nothing.  I've made thunder for
    Jupiter, odes for Apollo, battles for Mars, and love for Venus.
    I've married couples for Humen and six weeks afterwards, I've
    divorced them for Cupid, and in return I get all the kicks while
    they pocket the halfpence. And in compensation for robbing me of
    the halfpence in question, what have they done for me.</p> 
 
  
   <h5 class="name">AP.</h5> 
    <p class="speech Apollo"> they've—ha.ha.ha. they've made you the god of thieves.</p>
  
  
   <h5 class="name"> MER.</h5>
    <p class="speech Mercury">Very self denying of them.  There isn't one of them who
    hasn't a better claim to the distinction than I have. </p>
  
    <p class="song">Oh, I'm the celestial drudge,
      For morning to night I must stop at it.
      On errands all day I must trudge,
      And stick to my work til I drop at it.
      In summer I get up at one.
      (As a good-natured donkey I'm ranked for it.)
      then I go and I light up the sun.
      And Phoebus Apollo gets thanked for it.
      Well, well, it's the way of the world.
      And will be through all its futurity.
      Though noodles are baroned and earled,
      There's nothing for clever obscurity.<br><br>

      I'm the slave of the Gods, neck and heels,
      And I'm bound to obey, though I rate at 'em.
      And I not only order their meals,
      But I cook 'em and serve'em and wait at 'em.
      Then I make all their nectar, I do.
      (What a terrible liquor to rack us is.)
      And whenever I mix them a brew,
      Why all the thanksgivings are Bacchus's.
      Well, well, it's the way of the world, etc.....<br><br>

      The reading and writing I teach.
      And spelling-books many I've edited.
      And for bringing those arts within reach,
      That donkey Minerva gets credited.
      Then I scrape at the stars with a knife,
      And plate-powder the moon (on the days for it).
      And I hear all the world and his wife
      Awarding Diana the praise for it.
      Well, well, it's the way of the world, etc.... </p>

         <h5 class="name">DIA and MER </h5><p class="direction">[looking off]</p> <p class="speech DianaMer">Why, who's this? Jupiter, by Jove. </p>
  
    <p class="direction">[Enter Jupiter, an extremely old man, very decrepit, with very
    thin straggling white beard, he wears a long braided dressing
    gown, handsomely trimmed, and a silk night-cap on his head.
    Mercury falls back respectfully as he enters.] </p>
  
   <h5 class="name">JUP. </h5>
   <p class="speech Jupiter"> Good day, Diana.  Ah, Apollo.  Well, well, well, what's the
    matter? What's the matter? </p>
 
  <h5 class="name">DIA.</h5> 
  <p class="speech Diana">Why that young scamp Mercury says that we do nothing, and
    leave all the duties of Olympus to him. Will you believe it, he
    actually says that our influence on earth is dropping down to
    nil. </p>
 
 
   <h5 class="name">JUP.</h5>
   <p class="speech Jupiter"> Well, well. Don't be hard on the lad.  To tell you the
    truth, I'm not sure that he's far wrong. Don't let it go any
    further, but, between ourselves, the sacrifices and votive
    offerings have fallen off terribly of late. Why, I can remember
    the time when people offered us human sacrifices, no mistake
    about it, human sacrifices.  Think of that. </p>    <br><br>
